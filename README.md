the Nasa API. When the user enters their search, it will take you to that days photo. The date is also saved, so the user can
see previous search results. 

On the Mars page the user has access to information about Mars. They can switch between rovers and see photos provided by the selected rover.
The user also can see current tempratures on the martian planet.
